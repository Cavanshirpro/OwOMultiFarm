## Windows SmartScreen Warning

Windows may sometimes show a “SmartScreen” warning when launching the installer:  

> Windows protected your PC  
> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.  

This **is not caused by a virus or malware**, but because the app is from an **unrecognized publisher** and certain parameters (tokens, data files, etc.) may be missing.  

To safely run the application:  
1. Click “More info”.  
2. Select “Run anyway”.  

The program will then function normally.
